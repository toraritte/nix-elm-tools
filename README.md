# Nix Elm Tools

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/turboMaCk/nix-elm-tools.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/turboMaCk/nix-elm-tools)

[Elm](https://elm-lang.org/) lang community tooling
for the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix/) and [NixOS](http://nixos.org)
operating system.

## Motivation

Getting all the existing community tooling for Elm language running with nix is painful.
This is mostly due to the usage of [binary wrappers](https://github.com/avh4/binwrap) to make
haskell binaries and node.js work together. For instance `nodePackages.elm-test`
provided by [nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs) as of today
isn't working. I believe situation can be improved though!
Generally there are two ways to do so:

1. Remove all the hacks in upstream packages to make them nix compatible out of the box.
2. Implement custom nix specific builds for elm tooling with nix specific patches.

I've decided to start with 2nd. This project thus introduces expressions which
allow fully working builds using nix including all the patches.
As a next steps I'm going to identify [peice which seems to make sense to upstream](https://github.com/stoeffel/elmi-to-json/pull/28)
in order to simplify the build. My goal is to endup with easy to maitain builds which
can be merged into the [nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixOS/nixpkgs/).

## Rules

These are the rules followed:

1. [x] Builds on NixOS
2. [x] Builds are reasonably fast (eg. we avoid usage of stack2nix and large rebuilds of Haskell packages)
3. [x] Easy to pull from remote
4. [x] Nixpkgs like conventions
5. [x] Linux and MacOS portability
6. [x] Utilizing existing nix tooling

## Components

Tooling provided so far:

- [elm-test](https://github.com/rtfeldman/node-test-runner)

## Usage

nix-env from source:

```shell
# clone project
$ git clone https://github.com/turboMaCk/nix-elm-tools.git
$ cd nix-elm-tools

# install elm-test
$ nix-env -f default.nix -iA elm-test
installing 'node-elm-test-0.19.0-rev6'
building '/nix/store/bf69nj0mzfqajgip1bpxwg05y1zh7191-user-environment.drv'...
created 21 symlinks in user environment
```

remote install:

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};

  elmTools = import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "turboMaCk";
    repo = "nix-elm-tools";
    rev = "8168561d341ad5bafd5573d1e2a904d4d1fff7b2";
    sha256 = "0svag008jis34knyj7a59lmdhnz2b7h8mqh1arrkbl5yhpxg7n65";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in
{
  inherit (elmTools) elm-test elm-verify-examples;
}
```

nix-shell remote install:

```nix
{ pkgs ? import <nixpkgs> {} }:
let
  elmTools = import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "turboMaCk";
    repo = "nix-elm-tools";
    rev = "8168561d341ad5bafd5573d1e2a904d4d1fff7b2";
    sha256 = "0svag008jis34knyj7a59lmdhnz2b7h8mqh1arrkbl5yhpxg7n65";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in
  with pkgs;
  mkShell {
    buildInputs = with elmTools; [ elm-test elm-verify-examples ];
  }
```

nixos configuration remote install:

```nix
{ pkgs, ... }:
let
  elmTools = import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
    owner = "turboMaCk";
    repo = "nix-elm-tools";
    rev = "8168561d341ad5bafd5573d1e2a904d4d1fff7b2";
    sha256 = "0svag008jis34knyj7a59lmdhnz2b7h8mqh1arrkbl5yhpxg7n65";
  }) { inherit pkgs; };
in {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs.elmPackages; [
    elm
    elm-format
    pkgs.elm2nix
    elmTools.elm-test
    elmTools.elm-verify-examples
    elmTools.elm-analyse
    elmTools.elm-doc-preview
  ];
}
```

## Compiling Haskell

Haskell dependencies are by default compiled from source.
If you want to avoid compiling Haskell there is an optional `compileHS` argument.
When this is set to `false` statically linked binaries are downloaded from
[github releases](https://github.com/stoeffel/elmi-to-json/releases).

nix-env from command line:

```shell
$ nix-build -A elm-test --arg compileHS false
```

or with remote install via nix

```nix
let
  pkgs = import <nixpkgs> {};
in
import (pkgs.fetchFromGitHub {
  owner = "turboMaCk";
  repo = "nix-elm-tools";
  rev = "8168561d341ad5bafd5573d1e2a904d4d1fff7b2";
  sha256 = "0svag008jis34knyj7a59lmdhnz2b7h8mqh1arrkbl5yhpxg7n65";
}) { inherit pkgs; compileHS = false; }
```


## Development

All contributions are welcome. If you want to add a tool available via npm,
add it to `packages.json` and generete new nix files using `generate.sh`.

```
$ ./generate.sh
```

In order to make the tool exposed to the end user
edit the `default.nix` file and add it to the set it defines.
Some tools depends on `elmi-to-json` binary (usually installed
via npm with `binwrap`).
`binwrap` installation is not compatible with nix out of the box.
See `elm-test` as an example of how such package can be patched
by expressions provided as part of this repository.
